# How to Contribute

This is a free and open source software project. It is made possible by generous contributions from software engineers, both expert and novice, from around the world.

There are three ways that you can get involved, too:

* Ask questions
* Report bugs
* Suggest features

All contributions – questions, bug reports and feature suggestions – are managed via the project's [issue tracker][issues]. This is where our community of contributors congregates. We don't have a forum, social feed or IRC channel – just the issue tracker.

Please tag your issues "question", "bug" or "idea" as appropriate.

By participating in this project you accept the [Contributor License Agreement](cla.md) and you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

#### Ask Questions

Everyone is welcome to ask questions and initiate discussions about the project via the issue tracker.

If you require technical support, please first search for an answer in the issue tracker and on popular external Q&A sites such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). If you can't find a solution, please go ahead and ask your question by opening a new issue.

#### Bug Reports

Before reporting a bug, please first search the issue tracker to see if the error has been reported previously. If not, checkout the ``dev`` branch and try to reproduce the error there. The ``dev`` branch represents the most recent increment of the software, including unreleased increments. If the error cannot be reproduced in the ``dev`` branch, most likely it has already been resolved.

To fix bugs, the project maintainers must be able to reproduce them. A good bug report will therefore include at least one of the following:

* Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error
* A live example of the problem, e.g. a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)
* A screenshot, if reporting a visual regression
* A failing test case or demo

Describe the outcome that you expected, and what's different about the actual outcome. If relevant, provide details of the browser name, version number and operating system in which you experienced the error. If you think you can identify the source of the bug, such as a specific line or block of code, please include this information in your bug report.

Make a note if you are able to contribute a patch for the bug yourself.

#### Feature Requests

Ideas for new features and other enhancements to the project may also be submitted via the issue tracker.

Take a moment to consider whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the project, and what are the benefits versus costs of adding the feature. Make a note if you are willing to contribute the required changes yourself.

Feature suggestions will remain open in the issue tracker until they are approved or rejected by the project maintainers, who may be influenced by :+1: reactions and comments by the community.

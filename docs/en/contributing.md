# How to Contribute

This is a free and open source software project. It is made possible by generous contributions from software engineers, both expert and novice, from around the world. 

There are three ways that you can get involved, too:

- Request features
- Report bugs
- Contribute source code, documentation and tests

All contributions – bug reports, feature requests, and source changes – are managed via the project's [issue tracker][1]. 

By participating in this project you accept the [Contributor License Agreement](cla.md) and you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md)

## Feature Requests

Feature requests may be submitted via the [issue tracker][1].

Take a moment to consider whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the project, and what are the benefits versus costs of adding the feature.

Feature requests will remain open in the issue tracker until they are approved or rejected by the project maintainers, who will be influenced by :+1: reactions and comments by the community.

## Bug Reports

Before reporting a bug, please check that it has not been reported previously by searching the [issue tracker][1]. Also check that the problem has not already been fixed by trying to reproduce the problem in the master ``prod`` branch.

To fix an error, the project maintainers must be able to reproduce it. This requires you to be able to demonstrate the bug. A good bug report will therefore include at least one of the following:

- Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error.
- A live example of the problem, e.g. a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/).
- A screenshot if reporting a visual regression.
- A failing test case.

If relevant, please provide details of the browser name, version number, and operating system in which you experienced the error. Describe the outcome that you expected, and what's different about the actual outcome.

If you can identify the source of the bug, such as a specific line or block of code, please include this information in your bug report, too.

## Source Changes

The ultimate way to contribute to this project (indeed, to _any_ open source software project) is to contribute material changes to its source code, tests, and documentation. This is done using the pull request (PR) system.

_Please raise an issue before making a pull request_ and make a note if you would be willing to have the issue assigned to you. The project maintainers will review your bug report or feature request, and they will accept or reject it before you or someone else spends time implementing the fix or enhancement.

If the project maintainers accept the bug or feature, and if they assign you to work on it, you will need to fork-and-branch the source code repository, make your changes, and finally submit a pull request to have your changes merged into the main project repository. Refer to the [Workflow](workflow.md) section for detailed instructions.

Here are a few good practices for PRs:

- As a general rule of thumb, each change should have a corresponding test to go along with it.
- Pull requests should be focused. Try not to mix multiple orthogonal changes together.
- Pull requests should be made to the ``test`` branch in the upstream repository.

If you are unsure about any aspect of the PR process, please submit an early PR — before your work is complete — and one of the project maintainers will be assigned to guide you through.

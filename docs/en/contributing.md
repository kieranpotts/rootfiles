# How to Contribute

This is a free and open source software project. It is made possible by generous contributions from software engineers, both expert and novice, from around the world. 

There are three ways that you can get involved, too:

- Request features
- Report bugs
- Contribute source code, test, and documentation

All contributions – bug reports, feature requests, and source changes – are managed via the project's [issue tracker][1]. 

By participating in this project you accept the [Contributor License Agreement](cla.md) and you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md)

## Feature Requests

Feature requests may be submitted via the [issue tracker][1].

Take a moment to consider whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the project, and what are the benefits versus costs of adding the feature.

Feature requests will remain open in the issue tracker until they are approved or rejected by the project maintainers, who will be influenced by :+1: reactions and comments by the community.

## Bug Reports

Before reporting a bug, please search the [issue tracker][1] to see if the bug has been reported already. Also, please checkout the ``prod`` (production) branch and try to reproduce the error. If the bug does not exist in the very latest iteration of the software, it has already been fixed.

To fix bugs, the project maintainers must be able to reproduce them. A good bug report will therefore include at least one of the following:

- Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce the error
- A live example of the problem, e.g. a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)
- A screenshot, if reporting a visual regression
- A failing test case

Describe the outcome that you expected, and what's different about the actual outcome. If relevant, please provide details of the browser name, version number, and operating system in which you experienced the error. If you think you can identify the source of the bug, such as a specific line or block of code, please include this information in your bug report, too.

## Source Changes

The ultimate way to contribute to this project — indeed, to _any_ open source software project — is to contribute material changes to its source code, tests, and documentation. This is done using the pull request (PR) system.

Please raise an issue before making a pull request. The project maintainers will review your bug report or feature request, and they will accept or reject it before someone spends time implementing the fix or enhancement. Please make a note whether you would be willing to have the issue assigned to you to resolve.

If the project maintainers accept the bug or feature, and if they assign you to work on it, you will need to checkout a clone of the source code repository and undertake your work in your fork. When you are done, you will submit a pull request to have your changes merged into the main project repository. Please refer to the [Source Control Workflow](workflow.md) documentation for detailed instructions.

In the rush to push out functional changes, shortcuts may be taken that degrade the overall quality of the software. The backlog is a record of all the work that needs to be done to pay down the accumulated technical debt. Quality attributes that may need addressing include performance, security and maintainability.

Use the following template to add a work item to the backlog. Backlog work typically involves refactoring source code, upgrading dependencies, and extending the coverage of tests and documentation. Delete any sections from the template that are not applicable.

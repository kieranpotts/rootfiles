> Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of existing code without changing its external behaviour and interface. The objective of refactoring is to improve the _quality_ of software, rather than its functionality. 
>
> Refactoring sprints may focus on paying down technical debt or improving attributes such as performance, security and robustness.
>
> Use this template to log any work that needs to be done _urgently_ to address particular quality attributes of the software. Delete any sections that are not relevant.
